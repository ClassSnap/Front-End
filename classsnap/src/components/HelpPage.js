        <h3 id="help">What is ClassSnap?</h3>
        <p id="help">
          ClassSnap is an app that helps teachers to expand students' education
          outside of the classroom. With the ClassSnap platform, teachers can
          send out questions to parents on a regular basis. Parents will ask
          their child the question and evaulate their child's answer. Parents
          will rate the child's answer and send the rating (on a 5 point scale)
          back to the teacher for evaluation. The instant feedback can help
          teachers to make adjustments to your child's education.
        </p>
        <h3 id="help">Who created ClassSnap and why?</h3>
        <p id="help">
          ClassSnap is created by Karen Li, the Founder of ClassSnap LLC and a
          former teacher in San Antonio. Karen created ClassSnap because she
          recognized the need for parents, students and teachers to communicate
          more frequently. She wants to build tools for parents so that they can
          be proactive about their child's academic needs. She also hopes that
          the questions can help parents to have more meaningful conversation
          with their child.
        </p>
        <h3 id="help">Is using ClassSnap mandatory?</h3>
        <p id="help">
          No. ClassSnap is currently at its testing phase. Therefore,
          participation on this app is voluntary. We do encourage you to try it
          out to see if the product can help you and your child. We also
          encourage you to provide us with feedback so that we can improve the
          product for everyone.
